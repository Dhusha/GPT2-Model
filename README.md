## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to create a custom language model based on GPT-2, fine-tuned with GUVI-specific data, and deployed via a user-friendly web application. The application is designed to generate text responses based on user input.

## Data Collection and Preparation
1. Gather text data from various sources within GUVI, such as:
   - Website content
   - User queries
   - Social media
   - Blog posts
   - Training materials
2. Clean and preprocess the text data to ensure it is suitable for training:
   - Remove special characters
   - Normalize text

## Tokenization
1. Use the GPT-2 tokenizer to convert the prepared text data into tokens.
2. Ensure the data is tokenized consistently to match the pre-trained model's requirements.

## Fine-Tuning
1. Use the Hugging Face Transformers library to fine-tune the GPT-2 model on the prepared dataset.
2. Monitor the training process to:
   - Prevent overfitting
   - Ensure the model generalizes well to new data

## Web Application Development
1. Create a Streamlit application (`app.py`) to load the fine-tuned GPT model and generate text responses based on user input.
2. Design a user-friendly interface for interaction with the model.

## Infrastructure Setup
1. Store the `app.py` file and any additional necessary files in Hugging Face Spaces.

## Environment Configuration
1. Install required packages:
   - Streamlit
   - transformers
   - torch
2. Download the `app.py` file and paste it to Hugging Face.

## Application Deployment
1. Run the Streamlit application on Hugging Face Space.
2. Optionally use ngrok for temporary public access during testing.

## Security Configuration
1. Configure a security group to allow inbound traffic on the port used by the Streamlit app (default: 8501).

## Testing and Evaluation
1. Test the web application thoroughly to ensure it meets the project requirements and evaluation metrics.
2. Evaluate the functionality, performance, scalability, security, and usability of the application.

## Documentation
Prepare comprehensive documentation outlining:
   - Setup
   - Deployment
   - Usage instructions

## MySQL Connector Integration for User Management
This project integrates MySQL Connector for user authentication functionalities including signup, login, and password reset:

- **Signup**: Users can register by providing a username, email, and password. Data is securely stored in a MySQL database.
  
- **Login**: Validation of user credentials against stored records in the MySQL database ensures secure access to the application.
  
- **Password Reset**: Implemented functionality allows users to reset their passwords securely through email verification.
